# Become a Data Scientist with ChatGPT, Gemini and Python



# SKILLS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BUILD/DEVELOP
The skills that students will develop during the "Become a Data Scientist with ChatGPT – Gemini and Python" path are broad and aim to provide a solid foundation in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to the practical approach and direct interaction with advanced tools such as Python and ChatGPT, students will acquire technical, analytical and problem solving skills. Here is a description of the main skills developed:
1. Programming and technical skills in Python:
o Students will learn the basics of programming in Python, with a focus on the use of scientific libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. These skills will allow them to collect, organize, analyze and visualize data in an interactive and clear way, fundamental skills for those working in the Data Science field.
2. Use of Artificial Intelligence models:
o Students will learn how to exploit advanced linguistic models such as ChatGPT and Gemini to automate complex tasks and improve data analysis processes. They will be able to use these tools to explore datasets, generate custom Python code for analysis, and create interactive reports, making their work more efficient and structured.
3. Machine Learning Skills:
o They will be introduced to supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, learning to apply algorithms such as linear regression, neural networks, and classification. These skills will allow them to build predictive models and transform raw data into practical and strategic decisions.
4. Data analysis and problem solving:
o Through projects on real data, students will develop the ability to analyze and clean datasets, extract significant insights, and draw useful conclusions. They will learn to solve real-world problems in sectors such as the environment, economics, or marketing, providing data-driven solutions to support fact-based decisions.
5. Teamwork and project management:
o During the second phase of the path, students will work in groups on data analysis projects. They will learn to collaborate in teams, manage deadlines and divide tasks to complete a common project. This experience will prepare them to work in professional and academic contexts where cooperation is essential.
6. Critical thinking and decision-making skills:
o The entire path will stimulate students to develop strong critical thinking. Thanks to the use of data science and machine learning techniques, they will be able to tackle complex problems, analyze different solutions and choose the most effective one, based on a solid understanding of the data.
7. Communication skills and data presentation:
o At the end of the path, students will be able to create clear and interactive reports, presenting their analyses in a way that is understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences. This skill will be particularly useful to translate the results of their research into concrete actions and to communicate effectively with colleagues or superiors

# Course Structure:
The "Become a Data Scientist with ChatGPT – Gemini and Python" course is structured to provide students with a solid and applicative foundation in the field of Data Science, with a practical approach to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and programming.
60 hours of PCTO will be recognized only in the case of delivery of the final paper.
The course is aimed at motivated students with a strong interest in computer science and programming languages ​​and is organized as follows:

• The first training phase is divided into 12 in-person or online meetings, lasting 2 hours each, in which students will learn to use data analysis tools, such as Python, and to exploit the potential of advanced linguistic models such as ChatGPT and Gemini, to solve real problems through machine learning.
• A second phase in which students, divided into groups, will be engaged in the creation of a project that will involve the preparation of an analysis on real data (environmental, economic, marketing, etc.) in order to extract useful information to achieve some objectives.

Structure of the training phase:
1. Introduction to Data Science and AI: Students will acquire fundamental notions on what Data Science is, exploring the key concepts of data, predictive models and AI. Real applications will be illustrated to understand the importance of data management and analysis.
2. Python for Data Science: The basic concepts of Python will be addressed, with a focus on the most used libraries in the scientific field, such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. Students will learn to collect, organize and analyze datasets, visualizing the information in a clear and interactive way.
3. ChatGPT as a tool for Data Science: The potential of ChatGPT as a tool to support Data Science will be illustrated. Students will learn how to use ChatGPT to explore datasets, generate Python code for data analysis, automate complex tasks, and create interactive reports. Practical use cases will be presented, such as automatically extracting insights from data and generating hypotheses for predictive models.
4. Machine Learning: Students will be introduced to supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, with the aim of building predictive models on collected data and transforming insights into practical decisions. Algorithms such as linear regression, neural networks, and classification will be used.

Practical project: The course includes a project activity in which students will work in groups, on real datasets, to analyze concrete problems. The goal will be to apply what they have learned to create machine learning models, make predictions, and draw conclusions about the data. The project will include the delivery of a paper (notebook with Python code) and a presentation of the results.

The course will take place at the IIS headquarters in Via Roma 298 and online.

# Learning Methods:
The course combines lectures, hands-on programming exercises, collaborative projects, and real-world applications to ensure a well-rounded learning experience. Students will engage in problem-solving and critical thinking exercises that promote a deeper understanding of the material.
The course covers many topics related to different scientific disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, Computer Science and therefore there is no single textbook that contains all the topics.
