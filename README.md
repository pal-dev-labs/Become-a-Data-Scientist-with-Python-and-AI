# Instructions
You can follow the course with a laptop of the computer lab.
The coding environment that will be adopted is **Google Colab** which can be accessed with a browser (Chrome for example) from any PC, directly from the address https://colab.research.google.com/

In order to access the Google Colab environment you need a **Google account** (if you are not already provided with you can get one from the site https://www.google.com/intl/it/account/about/). Once you have created the Google account, try to log in to Google Colab to verify the access.

To import materials into Colab you also need a **GitHub account**. If you do not have one, you can create it from the website https://github.com/join

In order to check if everything is ok I suggest to follow the video here https://youtu.be/j7d2H6phnnQ

**REMEMBER** to bring with you to the computer lab **UID and PWD to access both Google and GitHub accounts**.

To follow the course, you can also use a personal laptop.
In this case you can choose to use either the Google Colab enviroment or the suite **Anaconda Navigator**, installed on your laptop
You can download **Anaconda Navigator** suite from the website https://www.anaconda.com/download. For the installation you can follow the video instructions published on the classroom website of the course (see below) or viewable on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mo3EP4Hy-k&t=115s
(Unfortunately with personal laptop you could experience problems with internet connection due to poor wi-fi internet connection)
